# --- Models ---
# Consider ignoring very large model files if they are not suitable for Git.
# If your .pkl files in the 'models' directory are very large (e.g., >100MB),
# you might consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage) or not versioning them directly.
# For now, if they are reasonably sized, you can keep them.
# If you decide to ignore them, uncomment the line below:
models/*.pkl

# --- Other ---
# Add any other files or directories that are generated, temporary, or specific to your local setup.
